## Structure of Program
**main.py** contains the main code for the program. `init()` is called when the program first starts, and controls flow. Methods for each option exist as subroutines within main.py. `bike_manager` is an instance of `BikeManager`, and is used to store & manipulate `Bicycle` objects.
