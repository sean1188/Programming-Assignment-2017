## At a glance

**main.py** is where all the main methods are executed.

**Classes.py** is where factory class `BikeManager` and concrete object `Bicycle` are defined for easy manipulation of bicycle information. Each `Bicycle` class has several `dump` functions that splat all attributes out in order to curry down formatting when displaying bicycle information.

**constants.py** contains useful methods, variables and lambdas used globally.

**BikeRider.py** is where the `BikeRider` proxy class is defined to manage each instance of a bike ride.

**SenseHatManager.py** I/O methods to the Pi's SenseHAT module.
